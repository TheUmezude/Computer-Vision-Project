Hello!

1) The answers to the question 1 are found in the python script titled: 'Nkem_Question_1_Solution.py'
---> Run the script, a prompt would be displayed to enter the file-path of the '.json' file you wish to analyze.
---> After entering the file-path, another prompt would be shown to ask you the operation you wish to perform.
--->   1. Get number of unique shape types.
--->   2. Get the frequency of each shape type.
--->   3. Get the frequency of the labels associated with the unique shape types.
--->   4. Generate an image where color is based on shape type (image would be saved to your PC as 'result1.png')
--->   5. Generate an image where color is based on annotation label (image would be saved to your PC as 'result2.png').

---> When you select an option, the program carries out the processing and gives the result. 
---> For options 4 and 5, the program generates a picture file and saves to the folder the script is contained in. 
---> Please note that I made the images to be line images, instead of block images, because I felt it was more visually pleasant.
---> I can change that if required.



2) The answers to the question 2 are found in the python script titled: 'Nkem_Question_2_Solution.py'
---> Run the script, a prompt would be displayed asking you to enter the folder name of the images you want to analyze.
---> Enter JUST the folder name. Not the Path (since the folder is contained in the folder that the script is).
---> Open the excel file to view the results.
